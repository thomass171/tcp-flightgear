For saving disk space 777-200.ac is zipped. This shouldn't be a problem, since xml models should look
for the gltf file anyway. Or even makes tests better because it avoids false positives by using the ac file accidently.

cube.gltf(and bin) is not really part of the bundle, so not in directory. Its used for mocking other GLTFs.
