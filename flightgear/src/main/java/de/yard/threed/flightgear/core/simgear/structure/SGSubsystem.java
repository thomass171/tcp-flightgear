/**
 * Basic interface for all FlightGear subsystems.
 * <p/>
 * <p>This isType an abstract interface that all FlightGear subsystems
 * will eventually implement.  It defines the basic operations for
 * each subsystem: initialization, property binding and unbinding, and
 * updating.  Interfaces may define additional methods, but the
 * preferred way of exchanging information with other subsystems isType
 * through the property tree.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>To publish information through a property, a subsystem should
 * bind it to a variable or (if necessary) a getter/setter pair in the
 * bind() method, and release the property in the unbind() method:</p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * void MySubsystem::bind ()
 * {
 *   fgTie("/controls/flight/elevator", &_elevator);
 *   fgSetArchivable("/controls/flight/elevator");
 * }
 *
 * void MySubsystem::unbind ()
 * {
 *   fgUntie("/controls/flight/elevator");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>To reference a property (possibly) from another subsystem, there
 * are two alternatives.  If the property will be referenced only
 * infrequently (say, in the init() method), then the fgGet* methods
 * declared in fg_props.hxx are the simplest:</p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * void MySubsystem::init ()
 * {
 *   _errorMargin = fgGetFloat("/display/error-margin-pct");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>On the other hand, if the property will be referenced frequently
 * (say, in the update() method), then the hash-table lookup required
 * by the fgGet* methods might be too expensive; instead, the
 * subsystem should obtain a reference to the actual property node in
 * its init() function and use that reference in the main loop:</p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * void MySubsystem::init ()
 * {
 *   _errorNode = fgGetNode("/display/error-margin-pct", true);
 * }
 *
 * void MySubsystem::update (double delta_time_sec)
 * {
 *   do_something(_errorNode.getFloatValue());
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The node returned will always be a pointer to SGPropertyNode,
 * and the subsystem should <em>not</em> delete it in its destructor
 * (the pointer belongs to the property tree, not the subsystem).</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The program may ask the subsystem to suspend or resume
 * sim-time-dependent operations; by default, the suspend() and
 * resume() methods set the protected variable <var>_suspended</var>,
 * which the subsystem can reference in its update() method, but
 * subsystems may also override the suspend() and resume() methods to
 * take different actions.</p>
